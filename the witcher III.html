				<h1>THE WITCHER III</h1>
				<p>Geralt finds himself traveling the road alone now in No Man's Land, also known as Velen, a region devastated by the war between the Nilfgaardian Empire and the Northern Kingdoms. Geralt can choose to begin his search here by seeking out emperor Emhyr's spy, Hendrik located in nearby Heatherton. Upon reaching the small village it is immediately clear that something evil has visited this town beyond the normal destruction caused by warring nations. From the clues the Witcher is able to gather from what is left of the now deceased spy's notes two possible leads on Ciri's whereabouts are deduced.</p>
				<p>The first clue is that Ciri met with the local warlord and now de facto ruler of Velen, Phillip Strenger nicknamed the Bloody Baron. Seeking out this self-proclaimed ruler enthroned at nearby Crow's Perch, Geralt must trade with the Baron his own time and skill locating the a missing wife and daughter in exchange for information about where Ciri may have gone. This seemingly simple task for someone as skilled as a witcher will take Geralt all over Velen and even into the city of nearby Novigrad. The stresses of alcoholism, infidelity, abuse and warfare combine to form a predictably poor outcome for the Baron and his family and leaves the Witcher having to make several difficult decisions between greater and lesser evils.</p>

				<p class="p1">The other lead Geralt may follow is a note that a woman fitting Ciri's description was seen to have quarreled with a witch. The people of Velen being very superstitious folk, a witch could mean anything from a local healer to a powerful sorceress, leaving not much to go on at first. In fact, the Witcher's first witch encounter turns out to be the wrong witch, when he finds Keira Metz living nearby the village of Midcopse. Long time friends, off and on lovers, the two team up to search for a mysterious elven mage whom Keira claims may have been helping Ciri. Unfortunately The Wild Hunt reaches the mage's underground cave first and the resulting fight and search of the caverns under The Mire yields little to no info about Ciri's whereabouts. Before leaving Keira suggests Geralt investigate Crookback Bog a location known to be home to a trio of Crones, maybe the witches that Ciri was heard to have tangled with. Geralt's investigation in the bog and meetings with its residents has a surprising tie-in with the Baron's search for his family and is overshadowed by an epic struggle, between the powerful Crones and a mysterious spirit, on which the lives of many depend.</p>
