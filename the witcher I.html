				<h1>THE WITCHER I</h1>
				<p>The first game opens with Geralt waking up at Kaer Mohren, one of the last remaining Witcher strongholds, after passing out in the forest with no memory of who he is or where he's been. Upon waking, he’s introduced to fellow Witchers Vessimir, Eskel and Leo, as well as the sorceress Triss Merigold who’s working with Geralt to restore his memories. Before they can make any progress, however, Kaer Mohren is attacked by the a group of bandits called the Salamandra, who steal the potions that make witchers witchers.</p>
				<p>Geralt follows the thieves to the city of Vizima and eventually finds out they’re working forJacque D’Aldersberg, the leader of the human supremacist group The Order of the Flaming Rose.  Fearing an oncoming apocalyptic event that he witnessed in a dream, D'Aldersberg plans to use the Witcher's mutagens to breed a race of superhumans that can survive the event and conquer the world.</p>
				<p>Geralt kills the thieves and D'Aldersberg, saves the day and gets a hearty clap on the back from his old buddy King Foltest. While Geralt doesn’t get his memory back, he does get a fat sack of gold from the king. The only problem is, as he’s about to leave the king is attacked. Geralt saves him, but it turns out that the assassin is - to Geralt's surprise - another Witcher.</p>
