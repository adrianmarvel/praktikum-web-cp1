				<h1>THE WITCHER II: ASSASSINS OF KINGS</h1>
				<p>Now in the employ of King Foltest - and the arms of Triss Merigold - Geralt helps the king rescue his illegitimate children from a former lover. Unfortunately, since things never go according to plan, the King is murdered by another assassin, who also happened to be a Witcher. Geralt is framed for the murder, thrown in jail, and interrogated by Temerian Supercop Vernon Roche.</p>
				<p>After hearing the other side of the story, Roche opts to give Geralt the chance to clear his name and hunt down Foltest’s true killer. The two escape together - along with Triss Merigold - and follow the assassin’s trail to the port town of Flotsam. Here, Geralt reunites with his old friends Zoltan the Dwarf and the bard, Dandelion.</p>
				<p>The group runs into Iorveth, a wanted criminal who leads a militant band of nonhuman rebels called the Scoia’tael, a group that wants equal rights with humans. It turns out that Iorveth helped the Witcher assassin to take out Foltest and Demavend - former king of the neighboring country of Aedirn - though it’s soon revealed that the mystery Witcher was only using the Scoia’tael, and had no intention of aiding their cause. Iorveth and Geralt confront the Assassin but Roche attacks the Scoia’tael and the Kingslayer escapes after a battle with Geralt, taking Triss Merigold as his hostage.</p>

				<p class="p1">Geralt and Co. follow their trail with either Iorveth or Roche to a battlefield on the Kaedweni-Aeidernian border that’s been put under a curse. If the Witcher goes to Aedirn with Iorveth, they’ll get embroiled in a power struggle for control of the kingdom, and if he follows Roche to Kaedwin he’ll have help King Henselt to solve a spooky ghost mystery.</p>
				<p class="p2">Either way, Geralt lifts the curse and finds out that the the Assassin of Kings’ true name is Letho, whom he’d actually met on his chase of the Wild Hunt, but had forgotten about because amnesia...an amnesia which is slowly starting to leave him. Letho was hired by the enchantress Sile DeTancerville and select members of the Lodge of Sorceresses - basically a “No Boys Allowed” group of powerful mages who also have managed to mind-control a dragon. They want to use it as leverage for their goal of creating a mage-only nation at a summit being held in Loc Muinne, where Triss Merigold has also been conveniently taken by spies from Nilfgaard.</p>
				<p class="p2">The plot thickens, however, when Letho appears with an invasion force and reveals that, in actuality, he was only working to destabilize the northern kingdoms for the Nilfgaardian Empire to invade. Geralt manages to either slay the dragon or set it free, rescue Triss, and can either kill or spare both Sile and Letho. Although he technically stops the Lodge’s plot and saves the day, the northern kingdoms have started to crumble, and the door is open for the onslaught of the Nilfgaardian war machine.</p>
